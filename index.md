# OCaml-containers

[Current documentation](last)

Containers is an extension of OCaml's standard library (under BSD license)
focused on data structures, combinators and iterators, without dependencies on
unix, str or num. Every module is independent and is prefixed with 'CC' in the
global namespace. Some modules extend the stdlib (e.g. CCList provides safe
map/fold_right/append, and additional functions on lists).
Alternatively, `open Containers` will bring enhanced versions of the standard
modules into scope.

The [README](https://github.com/c-cube/ocaml-containers/blob/master/README.adoc)
contains a tutorial and more explanations about what Containers is about.
