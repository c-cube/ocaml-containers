  (* Merge an [iter] of k heaps into one.
     Instead of folding [merge] in one pass (which would run in time O(k log N)
     where k is the number of heaps and N is the total number of elements), it
     is more efficient to merge heaps pairwise until only one remains; see e.g.
         Robert Tarjan, "Data Structures and Network Algorithms",
         Chapter 3.3 "Leftist heaps", 1983.
     or:
         Chris Okasaki, "Purely Functional Data Structures",
         Chapter 3.2 "Leftist heaps", Exercise 3.3, 1998
     This is independent of the representation of heaps, and, as long as merging
     is in time O(log n), this runs in time O(k + k*log(N/k)). Notice that this
     is a O(k + N) (if k is small wrt. N, this last upper bound is very loose).
     The code below uses additional space of only O(log(k)) at any moment;
     it avoids storing an intermediate list of length O(k).
