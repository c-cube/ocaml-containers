(** {1 Nativeint}

    Helpers for processor-native integers

    This module provides operations on the type [nativeint] of signed 32-bit integers 
    (on 32-bit platforms) or signed 64-bit integers (on 64-bit platforms). 
    This integer type has exactly the same width as that of a pointer type in the C compiler. 
    All arithmetic operations over nativeint are taken modulo 2{^32} or 2{^64} depending 
    on the word size of the architecture.

    Performance notice: values of type [nativeint] occupy more memory space than values of type [int], 
    and arithmetic operations on [nativeint] are generally slower than those on [int]. 
    Use [nativeint] only when the application requires the extra bit of precision over the [int] type.

val min : t -> t -> t
(** [min x y] returns the minimum of the two integers [x] and [y].
    @since NEXT_RELEASE *)

val max : t -> t -> t
(** [max x y] returns the maximum of the two integers [x] and [y].
    @since NEXT_RELEASE *)

val hash : t -> int
(** [hash x] computes the hash of [x].
    Like {!Stdlib.abs (to_int x)}. *)

val sign : t -> int
(** [sign x] return [0] if [x = 0], [-1] if [x < 0] and [1] if [x > 0].
    Same as [compare x zero].
    @since NEXT_RELEASE*)

val pow : t -> t -> t
(** [pow base exponent] returns [base] raised to the power of [exponent].
    [pow x y = x^y] for positive integers [x] and [y].
    Raises [Invalid_argument] if [x = y = 0] or [y] < 0.
    @since 0.11 *)

(** [floor_div x n] is integer division rounding towards negative infinity.
    It satisfies [x = m * floor_div x n + rem x n].

val range_by : step:t -> t -> t -> t iter
(** [range_by ~step i j] iterates on integers from [i] to [j] included,
    where the difference between successive elements is [step].
    Use a negative [step] for a decreasing list.
    @raise Invalid_argument if [step=0].
    @since NEXT_RELEASE *)

val range : t -> t -> t iter
(** [range i j] iterates on integers from [i] to [j] included . It works
    both for decreasing and increasing ranges.
    @since NEXT_RELEASE *)

val range' : t -> t -> t iter
(** [range' i j] is like {!range} but the second bound [j] is excluded.
    For instance [range' 0 5 = Iter.of_list [0;1;2;3;4]].

(** {2 Conversion} *)

val of_string : string -> t option
(** [of_string s] is the safe version of {!of_string_exn}.
    Like {!of_string_exn}, but return [None] instead of raising. *)

val of_string_opt : string -> t option
(** [of_string_opt s] is an alias to {!of_string}. *)

val of_string_exn : string -> t
(** [of_string_exn s] converts the given string [s] into a native integer.
    Alias to {!Nativeint.of_string}.
    Convert the given string to a native integer.
    The string is read in decimal (by default, or if the string
    begins with [0u]) or in hexadecimal, octal or binary if the
    string begins with [0x], [0o] or [0b] respectively.

    The [0u] prefix reads the input as an unsigned integer in the range
    [[0, 2*CCNativeint.max_int+1]]. If the input exceeds {!CCNativeint.max_int}
    it is converted to the signed integer
    [CCInt64.min_int + input - CCNativeint.max_int - 1].

    Raise [Failure "Nativeint.of_string"] if the given string is not
    a valid representation of an integer, or if the integer represented
    exceeds the range of integers representable in type [nativeint]. *)

val to_string_binary : t -> string
(** [to_string_binary x] returns the string representation of the integer [x], in binary.
    @since NEXT_RELEASE *)


(** {2 Printing} *)

val pp : t printer
(** [pp ppf x] prints the integer [x] on [ppf].
    @since NEXT_RELEASE *)

val pp_binary : t printer
(** [pp_binary ppf x] prints [x] on [ppf].
    Print as "0b00101010".
    @since NEXT_RELEASE *)

  val ( / ) : t -> t -> t
  (** [x / y] is the integer quotient of [x] and [y].
      Integer division.  Raise [Division_by_zero] if the second
      argument [y] is zero.  This division rounds the real quotient of
      its arguments towards zero, as specified for {!Stdlib.(/)}. *)

  val ( mod ) : t -> t -> t
  (** [x mod y] is the integer remainder of [x / y].
      If [y <> zero], the result of [x mod y] satisfies the following properties:
      [zero <= x mod y < abs y] and
      [x = ((x / y) * y) + (x mod y)].
      If [y = 0], [x mod y] raises [Division_by_zero]. *)

      and [64] on a 64-bit platform. *)

  val ( lsr ) : t -> int -> t
  (** [x lsr y] shifts [x] to the right by [y] bits.
      This is a logical shift: zeroes are inserted in the vacated bits
      regardless of the sign of [x].
      The result is unspecified if [y < 0] or [y >= bitsize]. *)

  val ( asr ) : t -> int -> t
  (** [x asr y] shifts [x] to the right by [y] bits.
      This is an arithmetic shift: the sign bit of [x] is replicated
      and inserted in the vacated bits.
      The result is unspecified if [y < 0] or [y >= bitsize]. *)

  val (<>) : t -> t -> bool
