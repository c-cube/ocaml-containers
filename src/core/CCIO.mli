(** IO Utils

    Simple utilities to deal with basic Input/Output tasks in a resource-safe
    way. For advanced IO tasks, the user is advised to use something
    like Lwt or Async, that are far more comprehensive.

    Examples:

    - obtain the list of lines of a file:

    {[
      # let l = CCIO.(with_in "/tmp/some_file" read_lines_l);;
    ]}

    - transfer one file into another:

    {[
      # CCIO.(
          with_in "/tmp/input"
            (fun ic ->
               let chunks = read_chunks_gen ic in
               with_out ~flags:[Open_binary; Open_creat] ~mode:0o644 "/tmp/output"
                 (fun oc ->
                    write_gen oc chunks
                 )
            )
        ) ;;
    ]}

    - Note that the lifetime of an IO generator is tied to the underlying
      channel. In the example above, [chunks] must be used in the scope of [ic].
      This will raise an error:

    {[
      # CCIO.(
          let chunks =
            with_in "/tmp/input"
              (fun ic -> read_chunks_gen ic)
          in
          with_out ~flags:[Open_binary;Open_creat] ~mode:0o644 "/tmp/output"
             (fun oc ->
                write_gen oc chunks
             )
        ) ;;
    ]}
