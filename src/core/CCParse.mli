(** Very Simple Parser Combinators

    These combinators can be used to write very simple parsers, for example
    to extract data from a line-oriented file, or as a replacement to {!Scanf}.

    {2 A few examples}

    Some more advanced example(s) can be found in the [/examples] directory.

    {4 Parse a tree}

    {[
      open CCParse;;

      type tree = L of int | N of tree * tree;;

      let mk_leaf x = L x
      let mk_node x y = N(x,y)

      let ptree = fix @@ fun self ->
        skip_space *>
          ( (char '(' *> (pure mk_node <*> self <*> self) <* char ')')
            <|>
              (U.int >|= mk_leaf) )
      ;;

      parse_string_exn ptree "(1 (2 3))" ;;
      parse_string_exn ptree "((1 2) (3 (4 5)))" ;;

    ]}

    {4 Parse a list of words}

    {[
      open Containers.Parse;;
      let p = U.list ~sep:"," U.word;;
      parse_string_exn p "[abc , de, hello ,world  ]";;
    ]}

    {4 Stress Test}
    This makes a list of 100_000 integers, prints it and parses it back.

    {[
      let p = CCParse.(U.list ~sep:"," U.int);;

      let l = CCList.(1 -- 100_000);;
      let l_printed =
        CCFormat.(to_string (within "[" "]" (list ~sep:(return ",@,") int))) l;;

      let l' = CCParse.parse_string_exn p l_printed;;

      assert (l=l');;
    ]}

    Some functions are marked "experimental" and are still subject to change.

type slice
(** A slice of the input, as returned by some combinators such
    as {!split_1} or {!split_list} or {!take}.

    The idea is that one can use some parsers to cut the input into slices,
    e.g. split into lines, or split a line into fields (think CSV or TSV).
    Then a variety of parsers can be used on each slice to extract data from
    it using {!recurse}.

    Slices contain enough information to make it possible
    for [recurse slice p] to report failures (if [p] fails) using locations
    from the original input, not relative to the slice.
    Therefore, even after splitting the input into lines using, say, {!each_line},
    a failure to parse the 500th line will be reported at line 500 and
    not at line 1.

    If they all fail, and [else_] is defined, then it behaves like [else_].

    This is a performance optimization compared to {!(<|>)}. We commit to a
