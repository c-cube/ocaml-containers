module Make(P : PARAM) : sig
  val run : (unit -> _) -> unit
  (** [run f] schedules [f] for being executed in the thread pool. *)

  val run1 : ('a -> _) -> 'a -> unit
  (** [run1 f x] is similar to [run (fun () -> f x)]. *)

  (** [active ()] is true as long as [stop()] has not been called yet. *)

      This has the effect of preventing new tasks from being executed. *)

  (** {6 Futures}

      The futures are registration points for callbacks, storing a {!state},
      that are executed in the pool using {!run}. *)

    (** Future that fails immediately. *)

    (** Create a future, representing a value that will be computed by
          the function. If the function raises, the future will fail. *)

    val make2 : ('a -> 'b -> 'c) -> 'a -> 'b -> 'c t

    (** {2 Basics} *)

    val get : 'a t -> 'a
    (** Blocking get: wait for the future to be evaluated, and get the value,
        or the exception that failed the future is returned.
        Raise e if the future failed with e. *)

    val state : 'a t -> 'a state
    (** State of the future. *)

    val is_done : 'a t -> bool
    (** Is the future evaluated (success/failure)? *)

    (** {2 Combinators} *)

    val on_success : 'a t -> ('a -> unit) -> unit
    (** Attach a handler to be called upon success.
        The handler should not call functions on the future.
        Might be evaluated now if the future is already done. *)

    val on_failure : _ t -> (exn -> unit) -> unit
    (** Attach a handler to be called upon failure.
        The handler should not call any function on the future.
        Might be evaluated now if the future is already done. *)

    val on_finish : 'a t -> ('a state -> unit) -> unit
    (** Attach a handler to be called when the future is evaluated.
        The handler should not call functions on the future.
        Might be evaluated now if the future is already done. *)

        in the array fails, [sequence_a l] fails too. *)

    (** [map_a f a] maps [f] on every element of [a], and will return
        the array of every result if all calls succeed, or an error otherwise. *)

    val sequence_l : 'a t list -> 'a list t
    (** Future that waits for all previous futures to terminate. If any future
        in the list fails, [sequence_l l] fails too. *)

        the first future that terminates, by failing if the future fails. *)

    val choose_l : 'a t list -> 'a t
    (** Choose among those futures (the first to terminate). Behaves like
        the first future that terminates, by failing if the future fails. *)

    val map : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a t -> 'b t
    (** Map the value inside the future. The function doesn't run in its
        own task; if it can take time, use {!flat_map} or {!map_async}. *)

    val map_async : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a t -> 'b t
    (** Map the value inside the future, to be computed in a separated job. *)

    val app : ('a -> 'b) t -> 'a t -> 'b t
    (** [app f x] applies the result of [f] to the result of [x]. *)

    val app_async : ('a -> 'b) t -> 'a t -> 'b t
    (** [app_async f x] applies the result of [f] to the result of [x], in
        a separated job scheduled in the pool. *)

    val sleep : float -> unit t
    (** Future that returns with success in the given amount of seconds. Blocks
        the thread! If you need to wait on many events, consider
        using {!CCTimer}. *)
