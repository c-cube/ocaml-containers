     let[@tail_mod_cons] rec map f = function
     | [] -&gt; []
     | x :: xs -&gt;
       let y = f x in
       y :: map f xs
    |</code> becomes (expressed in almost-source-form; the translation is in fact at the Lambda-level) <code>|
     let rec map f = function
     | [] -&gt; []
     | x :: xs -&gt;
       let y = f x in
       let dst = y :: Placeholder in
       map_dps dst 1 f xs; dst
     and map_dps dst offset f = function
     | [] -&gt;
       dst.offset &lt;- []
     | x :: xs -&gt;
       let y = f x in
       let dst' = y :: Placeholder in
       dst.offset &lt;- dst';
       map_dps dst 1 f fx
    |</code></p><p>In this example, the expression (y :: map f xs) had a call in non-tail-position, and it gets rewritten into tail-calls. TMC handles all such cases where the continuation of the call (what needs to be done after the return) is a &quot;construction&quot;, the creation of a (possibly nested) data block.</p><p>The code transformation generates two versions of the input function, the &quot;direct&quot; version with the same type and behavior as the original one (here just <code>map</code>), and the &quot;destination-passing-style&quot; version (here <code>map_dps</code>).</p><p>Any call to the original function from outside the let..rec declaration gets transformed into a call into the direct version, which will itself call the destination-passing-style versions on recursive calls that may benefit from it (they are in tail-position modulo constructors).</p><p>Because of this inherent code duplication, the transformation may not always improve performance. In this implementation, TMC is opt-in, we only transform functions that the user has annotated with an attribute to request the transformation.</p><div class="odoc-spec"><div class="spec value anchored" id="val-rewrite"><a href="#val-rewrite" class="anchor"></a><code><span><span class="keyword">val</span> rewrite : <span><a href="../Lambda/index.html#type-lambda">Lambda.lambda</a> <span class="arrow">&#45;&gt;</span></span> <a href="../Lambda/index.html#type-lambda">Lambda.lambda</a></span></code></div></div></div></body></html>
